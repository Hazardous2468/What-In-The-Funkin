# **Flashing lights warning!**


# An experimental fork of FNF dedicated to adding modchart support!
**By Hazard24**

A modified fork of the latest version of Friday Night Funkin' which allows the player to create and play modcharts in a very similar method to modcharting in NotITG with Mirin Template.

Do note that the aim of this fork is strictly focused on modcharting, it doesn't aim to fix any issues that may arise whenever the base game gets updated and breaks everything.

**Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/Hazardous2468/What-In-The-Funkin/wiki) for help on getting started on making your own modcharts!**


# What does it have?

Z Axis (3D) stuff, Arrowpath stuff, fancy holds, errr

Note: If you're trying to compile the code yourself, you might need to grab the arrowpath image from a stable release to put into the assets folder (cuz idk how to modify assets folder here lol)
