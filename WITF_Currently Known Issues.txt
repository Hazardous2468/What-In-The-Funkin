Fork specific issues (V0.9.1a):

- Pixel Notesplashes are incorrectly positioned when moving on the z axis
- Pixel arrowpath appears very large. Could also impact other notestyles with a different hold width and scale

- Passing nothing into a built-in lua function (like "centerPlayer()") will trigger an instant game crash.

- Offsets (input / visual) aren't properly tested

- non 4/4 time signatures untested

- flxStrip ignores camera alpha (this affects sustains and 3D notes)

- If zsort is enabled earlier then beat -5, then the strums appear invisible.

- Hurts can visually be seen being hit on some custom players while not for others. Thankfully this is just a visual bug and not anything to be worried about as the hurt logic now only works for player 1.

- New hold sudden / hidden logic doesn't work if there are multiple hidden / sudden mods (can only have one of each type active at a time). 

- The custom freeplay card for modchart hell is pretty buggy (should be fine when custom backing cards are added though)

- Some mods may have slight differences between upscroll and downscroll. Be sure to check both scroll directions for your modcharts!

- No good way of setting subdivisions for 3D render mod (YET!)

- AFT's seem to cause minor but consistent lag spikes? ðŸ˜”

- AFT's act a bit strangly when pointed at themselves

- Sometimes holds / notes will be incorrectly layered when using Zsort mod
  (v0.8.0a introduces a scuffed work around by adjusting zSortMod_SustainOffset and zSortMod_StrumNoteOffset in the PlayState instance.)

- Custom path mod jank (just try to stick to values between '0 - 1')

- Holds will have a visual flicker / stutter when being hitting on the first frame.
  -The same can sometimes be seen on the first frame of a notesplash being created

- 3D mesh renderer will still sometimes have lag spikes when loading new graphics mid song. Please try to preload any 3D sprites in before they get used!





V-Slice v0.6.4 issues:

- Memory leaks and bad performance x.x (especially with FlxText!!!)

- Visual bugs

- Cannot save / load anything without risking a game freeze (such as in the chart editor)

- Resizing the game when a shader is active breaks the shader (v0.7.6a ports the Inhuman fix to this problem since this fork already overrides the flxCamera for drawTriangles culling)

- Mouse bugs lol

- By default, the Conductor on Freeplay never gets updated. This fork adds a script which fixes that.

- Input / visual offsets bugs
