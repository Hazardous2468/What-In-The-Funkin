Fork specific issues (V1.0.0a):

- Hitting a hold early will sometimes make them bug out visually

- Chart editor crashes when leaving and re-entering it sometimes
- Also sprite null crash when hot reloading with F5 sometimes

- Misses may randomly occur when skipping forward / backward in a song

- Playing in story mode and transitioning to another song will break the debug visual scripts.
- Some other scripts will also break when transitioning such as metamodifiers.

- Hold covers sometimes fail to disappear

- Incorrect animation speeds with zSort enabled

- Metamods menu softlocks the story menu state
- Metamods will not apply turn/chart modifiers unless you enter and exit the menu
- Chaos mode is still a WIP so there are some issues with it that will be eventually fixed

- Incorrect playfield skewing with 3D mode enabled

- Freeplay DJ for Modchart Hell sometimes disappears

- Passing nothing into a built-in lua function (like "centerPlayer()") will trigger an instant game crash.

- Offsets (input / visual) aren't properly tested

- flxStrip ignores camera alpha (this affects sustains and 3D notes [might be fixed in v1.0])

- If zsort is enabled earlier then beat -5, then the strums appear invisible.

- Hurts can visually be seen being hit on some custom players while not for others. Thankfully this is just a visual bug and not anything to be worried about as the hurt logic now only works for player 1.

- New hold sudden / hidden logic doesn't work if there are multiple hidden / sudden mods (can only have one of each type active at a time). 

- Some mods may have slight differences between upscroll and downscroll. Be sure to check both scroll directions for your modcharts!

- No good way of setting subdivisions for 3D render mod (YET!)

- AFT's seem to cause minor but consistent lag spikes? ðŸ˜”

- AFT's act a bit strangly when pointed at themselves

- Sometimes holds / notes will be incorrectly layered when using Zsort mod
  (v0.8.0a introduces a scuffed work around by adjusting zSortMod_SustainOffset and zSortMod_StrumNoteOffset in the PlayState instance.)
Update: v1.0 may have brought back this issue, how fun!

- Custom path mod jank (just try to stick to values between '0 - 1')

- Note Splashes will have a visual flicker / stutter when being hitting on the first frame sometimes.



V-Slice v0.6.4 issues:

- non 4/4 time signatures don't work

- Memory leaks and bad performance x.x (especially with FlxText!!!)

- Visual bugs

- Cannot save / load anything without risking a game freeze (such as in the chart editor)

- Resizing the game when a shader is active breaks the shader (v0.7.6a ports the Inhuman fix to this problem since this fork already overrides the flxCamera for drawTriangles culling)

- Mouse bugs lol

- Input / visual offsets bugs
